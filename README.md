# Smile Game Builder - Icy's Mods
Not sure exactly what this repo will be yet - but my goal is to make the SGB Unity Exported scripts a little more flexible. For Cobysoft Joe's [Dome-King Cabbage](https://cobysoft.co/), it'd be nice to use for one-off gameplay bits.

At the moment, this is a modification of the SGB export code itself. This mod implements Unity's new input system and also allows for the importing of multiple SGB exports into one Unity project.
